# CO2 Emissions of Cars Based on Engine Size, Cylinders, and Fuel Consumption

This README file provides information on how the engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption of a car affect its CO2 emissions. The data used for this comparison is based on the latest available information as of September 2021.

## Comparators

The following are the comparators used in this comparison:

- ENGINESIZE: The size of the car's engine, measured in liters (L).
- CYLINDERS: The number of cylinders in the car's engine.
- FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB: The amount of fuel consumed by the car to travel a certain distance, measured in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100 km).
- CO2EMISSIONS: The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the car, measured in grams per kilometer (g/km).

## How Engine Size, Cylinders, and Fuel Consumption Affect CO2 Emissions

The engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption of a car all have an impact on the amount of CO2 emissions produced. Here's how:

- Engine Size: A larger engine size typically means more fuel consumption, which in turn leads to higher CO2 emissions. Therefore, cars with larger engine sizes tend to have higher emissions than those with smaller engine sizes.

- Cylinders: The number of cylinders in a car's engine also affects fuel consumption and emissions. Generally, cars with more cylinders consume more fuel and produce more emissions than those with fewer cylinders.

- Fuel Consumption: The amount of fuel a car consumes directly affects its emissions. Cars with higher fuel consumption tend to produce more emissions than those with lower fuel consumption.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the size of a car's engine, the number of cylinders, and its fuel consumption are all factors that affect the amount of CO2 emissions produced. As a general rule, cars with larger engines, more cylinders, and higher fuel consumption tend to have higher emissions than those with smaller engines, fewer cylinders, and lower fuel consumption. 

It is important to consider these factors when choosing a car, as vehicles with lower emissions can help to reduce carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable environment.
